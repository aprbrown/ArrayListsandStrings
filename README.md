# ArrayLists and String

This was a small preparatory assignment done during a lab session in CSC8001 - Programming and Data Structures at Newcastle University. The program reads a text file and creates a separate file with a word count for the original text.

# What I Learned

* Basics of file input/output
* Iterating through a file and extracting words from it
* Determining unique words via a HashSet
